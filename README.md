Game Of Life
=========

TDD example using Game Of Life

* Write a test
* Watch the test fail
* Write **just enough** code to make it pass or to change the failing message
* Refactor the code and tests, making sure the tests still pass
* Go back to step 1

org.games.life.Game is the API consumer and is therefore not tested with unit tests. It should still be tested, but with acceptance tests instead.
